    "\n",
    "1. Imports and Setup\n",
    "Libraries:\n",
    "PyTorch (for deep learning)\n",
    "torchvision (for models and transforms)\n",
    "PIL (image handling)\n",
    "pandas (data handling)\n",
    "scikit-learn (metrics)\n",
    "matplotlib & seaborn (visualization)\n",
    "tqdm (progress bars)\n",
    "Device Selection:\n",
    "Automatically selects GPU if available.\n",
    "2. Data Handling\n",
    "Custom Dataset (MultimodalDataset):\n",
    "\n",
    "Loads images from six different directories, each representing a different imaging modality.\n",
    "Applies the same transform to all modalities.\n",
    "Returns a tuple of six images and the label for each sample.\n",
    "Transforms:\n",
    "\n",
    "Images are resized, randomly flipped (augmentation), converted to tensors, and normalized using ImageNet statistics.\n",
    "Data Splitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is split into training (70%), validation (10%), and test (20%) sets using a fixed random seed for reproducibility.\n",
    "DataLoaders are created for each split.\n",
    "3. Model Architecture\n",
    "MultimodalModelWithConvFusion:\n",
    "Uses six separate ResNet-18 backbones (one per modality), each pretrained on ImageNet.\n",
    "The final fully connected layer of each backbone is replaced with an identity layer to extract features.\n",
    "Features from all modalities are concatenated (resulting in a 3072-dimensional vector).\n",
    "A 1x1 convolution reduces this to 512 channels.\n",
    "A fully connected classifier outputs the final prediction (binary classification).\n",
    "4. Training and Validation\n",
    "Training Loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "For each epoch, the model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the validation set.\n",
    "Loss and accuracy are tracked for both sets.\n",
    "The model with the best validation loss is saved.\n",
    "Metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary cross-entropy loss is used.\n",
    "Accuracy is computed by thresholding the sigmoid output at 0.5.\n",
    "5. Testing and Evaluation\n",
    "Test Function:\n",
    "Evaluates the best model on the test set.\n",
    "Computes loss, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, confusion matrix, and ROC AUC.\n",
    "6. Visualization\n",
    "Loss and Accuracy Curves:\n",
    "Plots and saves training/validation loss and accuracy curves over epochs.\n",
    "Confusion Matrix:\n",
    "Plots and saves a heatmap of the confusion matrix using seaborn.\n",
    "7. Key Points for Presentation\n",
    "Multimodal Fusion:\n",
    "The model leverages information from multiple imaging modalities, potentially improving classification performance over single-modality approaches.\n",
    "Reproducibility:\n",
    "Fixed random seeds and clear data splits ensure reproducibility.\n",
    "Comprehensive Evaluation:\n",
    "Multiple metrics and visualizations provide a thorough assessment of model performance.\n",
    "Modular Design:\n",
    "The code is organized into reusable functions and classes, making it easy to adapt or extend.\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a robust pipeline for multimodal image classification, from data preprocessing to model evaluation and visualization, using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me know if you want a slide-wise breakdown or more focus on any specific section!"
